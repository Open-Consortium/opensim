# Overview
Consortium is a fork of OpenSim. It is the "successor" to Mobius. 

The goals for Consortium are simple, we want to:   
- Add support for more of the features already in the viewer
- Extend upon existing features   
- Add new features in a non-invasive and optional way   
- Donate features to OpenSim via the Mantis

Consortium's current "claim to fame" is Display Name support and Experience Tools.

# Additional Features
Consortium has the following features that are not yet adopted by OpenSim:
- Display Names   
- Experience Tools   
- New Region Restart Notice    
- Port range for Simulators    
- IP binding for ROBUST    
- Extra Inworld Region Console Commands    
- IP and Hardware Banning    
- Updated Top Scripts floater   
- ToS prompt during the login   

As well as some minor fixes not worth mentioning.
